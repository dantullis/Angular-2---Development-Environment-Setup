# Angular 2 - Development Environment Setup

This is how to easily setup your development environment to create an Angular 2 we application. 

### Features
 - Getting comfortable with Node Package Manager(NPM) installations via command line
 - Lightweight code editor - Visual Studio Code

### Software to Install
 - Node.js - (https://nodejs.org/en/) - Download the v4.x.x LTS version. This is the version that most applications and packages still have a dependency on. 

    Afterwards, open your terminal/command window and verify version with the following command:
    ```
    node -v
    ```
 - Node Package Manager (NPM) - Node.js includes a version of NPM already. However, you may want to get a newer version. 
 
    Verify version with the following command:
    ```
    npm -v
    ```
    
    If you need to install a newer version you can do the following command: 
 
    ```
    npm install npm -g
    ```
 
    The -g stands for global. As opposed to just for an individual project.
